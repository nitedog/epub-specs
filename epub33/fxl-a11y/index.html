        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <section id="intro-overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>EPUB fixed layout (FXL) publications, or publications where the print layout is preserved in the digital edition, have been around since before EPUB 3.0.1. These publications span a number of genres and types, from comic books, cook books, children's books, and more.</p>

            <p>An accessible fixed layout EPUB file is one that meets the accessibility requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 level AA [[wcag2]] and EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]], including color contrast, reading order, font layout, structural navigation, metadata, and text alternatives.</p>

            <p>The main motivation behind creating fixed layout publications is the need to preserve the print layout of the book, either because of it's importance to the text (i.e. complex diagrams) or it's artistic purpose (i.e. illustrated text). However, these publications are often partially or completely inaccessible to people with print disabilities.</p>

            <p>This note serves to help <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a>, publishers, and reading systems address some of the common accessibility issues found in fixed layout content including navigation, reading order, and text alternatives. This document is a companion to EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]], specifically for fixed layout publications. All recommendations made in EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]], EPUB 3.3 [[epub-33]], and EPUB Reading Systems 3.3 [[epub-rs-33]] are applied and extended here.</p>

            <p>In addition to the recommendations in this document, the Publishing Maintenance Working Group's Fixed Layout Accessibility Task Force is producing an accompanying <a href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/fxl-a11y-tech">techniques document</a> to cover the technical side of FXL accessibility.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="intro-limits">
            <h3>The limits of fixed layout accessibility</h3>

            <p>Fixed layout publications present some unique challenges for accessibility. The requirements laid out in EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]] recommend WCAG 2 level AA [[wcag2]], but for some use cases in fixed layout, that might not be possible without changes to the content. In this document, we will align recommendations with WCAG 2 level AA where possible, but will exclude success criteria that do not apply to fixed layout content.</p>

            <p>In particular, the needs of people with low vision or learning disabilities that rely on the transformation of text (i.e. dyslexia) are still almost impossible to accommodate in fixed layout content. EPUB creators concerned about this may choose not to use fixed layout.</p>

            <p>We want to recognize these challenges for EPUB creators, and in this document will outline some recommendations for producing more accessible fixed layout content. We encourage EPUB creators to explore the full range of options for accessibility that digital publications present, even when creating fixed layout publications.</p>

            <p>Reading systems also play a role in presenting accessible content. This document will outline considerations specific to accessibility for fixed layout in reading systems, and methods reading systems can apply to make content more accessible.</p>

        <section id="intro-principles">
            <h3>Accessibility principles and fixed layout</h3>

            <p>WCAG [[wcag]] is structured around four main principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. These principles are the foundation of web accessibility and a helpful way to group and understand the guidelines and success criteria required to make content accessible. Not all WCAG success criteria apply to fixed layout content.</p>

            <p>We will use the principles to demonstrate how accessibility success criteria relate to fixed layout content.</p>

            <section id="principles-perceivable">
                <h4>Perceivable</h4>

                <p>Content must be presented and built in a way that allows it to be perceivable to all of a user's senses. This principle requires fixed layout content be built in a way that supports multiple reading methods - visual, audible, and tactile. This principle and its related success criteria are achieved by providing text alternatives for images, using proper markup to structure content, and ensuring visual content is well contrasted and designed.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.1.1 Non-text Content</li>
                    <li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships</li>
                    <li>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</li>
                    <li>1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics</li>
                    <li>1.4.1 Use of Color</li>
                    <li>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</li>
                    <li>1.4.4 Resize Text</li>
                    <li>1.4.5 Images of Text</li>
                    <li>1.4.10 Reflow</li>
                    <li>1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</li>
                    <li>1.4.12 Text Spacing</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="principles-operable">
                <h4>Operable</h4>

                <p>Content and navigation must be operable, built in a way that makes it usable for all users. This principle, when applied to fixed layout content, is achieved through consistent navigation and content structure.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>2.4.2 Page Titled</li>
                    <li>2.4.3 Focus Order</li>
                    <li>2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)</li>
                    <li>2.4.6 Headings and Labels</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="principles-understandable">
                <h4>Understandable</h4>

                <p>Content must be understandable. This principle has limited application to fixed layout content aside from the importance of proper language labelling.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>3.1.1 Language of Page</li>
                    <li>3.1.2 Language of Parts</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="principles-robust">
                <h4>Robust</h4>

                <p>Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a variety of user agents, reading systems, and assistive technologies. For fixed layout content, achieving this principle requires the EPUB file to be well-formed and all content must use proper markup.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>4.1.1 Parsing (note: this success criteria is no longer applicable in WCAG 2.2, but may remain important to EPUB rendering).</li>
                    <li>4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</li>

        <section id="development-considerations">
            <h3>Considerations for fixed layout content development</h3>

            <p>EPUB 3.3 [[epub-33]] supports multiple methods for content development, particularly for fixed layout content. The two primary methods are to use XHTML and SVG for building EPUB content documents. A third method used in many EPUB FXL books is to reference image files in the spine of the EPUB file. We will discuss the accessibility considerations for all three methods in this document.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="reading-order">
            <h3>Reading order</h3>

            <blockquote>A key concept of EPUB is that an EPUB publication consists of multiple resources that can be completely navigated and consumed by a person or program in some specific order. - 1.2.1 Reading Order EPUB 3.3 Overview [[epub-overview-33]]</blockquote>

            <p>Whereas many reflowable publications have an obvious reading order, or logical progression through their content, fixed layout publications are often more complex in their design and layout and may consist of multiple readable objects on the same page.</p>

            <p>For viewers of the visual page, the reading order can be inferred by various visual triggers including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Size and styles of font used</li>
                <li>Design features such as imagery and colored backgrounds</li>
                <li>Position on the page top to bottom, left to right (or right to left depending on the language)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition, there may be text and image objects on the fixed layout page which are not required to be included in reading order, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Page numbers</li>
                <li>Running headers</li>
                <li>Other purely decorative objects</li>
            </ul>

            <p>WCAG [[wcag2]] has several success criteria that relate to order of content that should also be considered:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A)</li>
                <li>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (A)</li>
                <li>2.4.3 Focus Order (A)</li>
                <li>2.4.6 Headings and Labels (AA)</li>
            </ul>

            <section id="reading-order-altering">
                <h4>Altering the reading order</h4>

                <blockquote>If a blind user, who reads the page with a screen reader that follows the source order, is working with a sighted user who reads the page in visual order, they may be confused when they encounter information in different orders. A user with low vision who uses a screen magnifier in combination with a screen reader may be confused when the reading order appears to skip around on the screen. A keyboard user may have trouble predicting where focus will go next when the source order does not match the visual order. - <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C27">Making the DOM order match the visual order</a></blockquote>

            </section>

            <section id="reading-order-removing">
                <h4>Removing items from the reading order</h4>

                <p>There may be cases when text appears on the page but is unnecessary, duplicated or otherwise confusing for it to be added to the reading order. e.g. page numbers, section or chapter headings which are already part of the publication’s structure or text used for visual effects.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="reading-order-spreads">
                <h4>Reading order across the 'fold'</h4>

                <p>Fixed layout documents can be presented as synthetic spreads when a left and right page are presented together as a spread. As each page of the fixed-layout document is a separate XHTML document it is expected that reading order moves through there document from left to right (when using left to right page progression) but is not possible for the reading order to move from the left to the right and then back to the left page again.</p>

                <p>If the text must be read in this way, the only solution to maintain the correct reading order is to convert the double page spread in to a single landscape page that contains the entire content of the spread and for the EPUB to be rendered as single pages.</p>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section id="images">
            <h3>Images in fixed layout</h3>

            <section id="images-overview">
                <h4>Overview</h4>

                <p>Images are often an integral part of fixed layout publications. Fixed layout publications sometimes consist entirely of images, in the case of comics, or images may be used as backgrounds to a story, as in children's books. Fixed layout content where images serve as both the content and the layout pose a particular challenge for EPUB creators interested in accessibility.</p>

                <p>Ensuring that the information conveyed in the images is available to users who may not be able to perceive the image or may have difficulty processing it, is consequently of high priority in making fixed layouts as accessible as possible.</p>

                <p>WCAG [[wcag2]] has several success criteria that apply to the presentation and accessibility of images:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.1.1 Non-text Content (A)</li>
                    <li>1.4.1 Use of Color (A)</li>
                    <li>1.4.5 Images of Text (AA)</li>
                    <li>1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The <a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/images.html">basic requirements for all images</a> are to provide alternative text and extended descriptions when they contain information necessary to understanding the publication, which applies to fixed layouts. For example, while a reader may be able to follow the dialogue of a story when it is overlaid as text, only the placement on image might give context to what character is saying what.</p>

                <p>One challenge with fixed layouts is finding ways to describe the image and provide context given that there is no extra area on the page users can access in which to place a description. The other challenge is for content where the text is rasterized as part of the image, which can be unavoidable for content where the text is hand-drawn or part of the image.</p>

                <p>Image descriptions and alternative text do have limits in their ability to translate image content to text, those limitations include the ability to adequately map the flow of action on a page to text, or translation of visual effects to textual equivalents. Work continues in this area to improve this experience, and we will note gaps in the sections below.</p>

            </section>

            <section id="images-alt-text">
                <h4>Alternative text and image descriptions</h4>

                <p>Describing images within a fixed layout book will somewhat depend on the type of book these images are within. For example describing a childrens picture book will be quite different than if this is a fixed layout graphic novel such as a comic book.</p>

                <h4>Complex image descriptions</h4>

                <p>Depending on the complexity of the image this may require complex description with one of the following formats:</p>

                <ul>

                </ul>

                <p>If an image splits over two pages, put the full image description of both images in the first image and in the second image reference back to the first. See <a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/fxl/spreads.html">Multiple Page Spreads</a>.</p>

                <p>If there are a group of images in sequence, you only have to describe details in the first image. In the proceeding images only mention what has changed.</p>

                <p>Not all details are needed in writing alternative text for images, and what you do describe relies heavily on context. For example, if the image is described in the surrounding text, you only need to briefly describe it in the alternative text.</p>

            <h3>Navigation</h3>

            <p>Effective navigation of fixed layout EPUB can be as important for accessibility as it is for reflowable EPUB. Many of the EPUB accessibility features found in reflowable EPUB can still be used in fixed layout.</p>

            <p>WCAG [[wcag2]] has several success criteria relating to navigation:</p>

            <h3>Legibility and visual presentation</h3>

            <p>The legibility, or readability, of fixed layout content is an important contributing factor to its accessibility, particularly for users with low vision, cognitive, or learning disabilities. As text in a fixed layout document is unalterable, it is important to consider best practices in putting together clear, legible documents. EPUB creators are reminded that ebooks can be read on a number of different screen sizes and devices, many that will be smaller than the print version of the page. Designs for fixed layout content should take into account these smaller screen sizes and their impact on legibility and layout. This section will focus on what to consider when constructing more legible fixed layout publications.</p>

            <p>WCAG [[wcag2]] has a number of success criteria relating to the presentation of content:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1.1.1 Non-text Content (A)</li>
                <li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A)</li>
                <li>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (A)</li>
                <li>1.3.4 Orientation (AA)</li>
                <li>1.4.1 Use of Color (A)</li>
                <li>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)</li>
                <li>1.4.4 Resize Text (AA)</li>
                <li>1.4.5 Images of Text (AA)</li>
                <li>1.4.10 Reflow (AA)</li>
                <li>1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA)</li>
                <li>1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA)</li>
                <li>2.4.6 Headings and Labels (AA)</li>
                <li>3.2.4 Consistent Identification (AA)</li>
            </ul>

            <section id="legibility-adjustment">
                <h4>Visual adjustments</h4>

                <p>Due to the formatting constraints presented by fixed layout content, some success criteria relating to the presentation of content can be challenging or impossible to meet.</p>

                <p>The following Success Criteria relate to the visual adjustability or layout of content:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.3.4 Orientation (AA)</li>
                    <li>1.4.4 Resize Text (AA)</li>
                    <li>1.4.10 Reflow (AA)</li>
                    <li>1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Aside from the ability to zoom, most fixed layout reading systems do not allow the reader to adjust the visual presentation of the content by resizing text or adjusting the text layout (letter, word, line spacing, or margins). EPUB creators also have the ability to set specific orientation settings for FXL EPUBs.</p>

                <p>These limitations in how EPUB reading systems display FXL content mean that this content is exempt from some of these requirements, specifically, 1.3.4 and 1.4.10. These limitations also result in an automatic failure of 1.4.4 and 1.4.12. These constraints mean EUPB creators should consider these requirements as much as possible during the design of the content. EPUB creators can do this by considering:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Orientation: it is possible to set a fixed orientation in FXL content by using the orientation properties in the package metadata. Many reading systems will respect this setting, but allow users to override it to their own preferences. When designing content, consider whether setting an orientation setting is essential to the content's presentation.</li>
                    <li>Text size: since text size will not be adjustable, consider using a base font size that is comfortable to read on a variety of screen sizes.</li>
                    <li>Text spacing: the margins, letter, word, and line spacing of a FXL EPUB will not be adjustable, so consider designing the content with spacing that is comfortable to read on a variety of screen sizes.</li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section id="legibility-visual">
                <h4>Visual design</h4>

                <p>Many of the Success Criteria mentioned previously focus on the content being programmatically available to the user (accessible to assistive technology), but the same principles that are communicated programmatically can also be communicated visually. For example, most content design makes a visual differentiation between heading and body text, as a visual indicator of their relationship. Programmatically, we use elements like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to achieve this. Visually, we do this by styling headings with larger text, different colours, or a different font face.</p>

                <p>Success Criteria like the following can be achieved with conscientious visual design:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A)</li>
                    <li>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (A)</li>
                    <li>1.4.1 Use of Color (A)</li>
                    <li>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)</li>
                    <li>2.4.6 Headings and Labels (AA)</li>
                    <li>3.2.4 Consistent Identification (AA)</li>
                </ul>

                <section id="legibility-visual-relationships">
                    <h5>Relating content through placement</h5>

                    <p>Success Criteria 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 2.4.6, and 3.2.4 all cover ensuring content is programmatically related and identifiable as it is presented visually. That visual presentation is essential for all kinds of content, but for fixed layout EPUBs, can be even more essential.</p>

                    <p>Due to the constraints FXL presents, and the potential devices FXL content can be used on, EPUB creators need to consider how the visual design of their content may present challenges to users with low vision, cognitive, or learning disabilities.</p>

                    <p>When designing this content, consider the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Proximity: related content (e.g. headings and body text) should be placed in proximity to one another, so that a reader can understand their relationship.</li>
                        <li>Reading order: the reading order of how content is placed on the page should follow the standard pattern of the language the content is in (e.g. in English, the expected pattern is left-to-right, top-to-bottom).</li>
                        <li>Consistency: when considering the visual treatment of components (e.g. headings, asides, figures), ensure they use a consistent design, so a reader can understand their purpose using visual cues.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>EPUB creators should also consider testing their content during the design and development process on a number of different screen sizes and zoom levels, to help understand any potential challenges a reader may face.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="legibility-visual-color">
                    <h5>Use of color</h5>

                    <p>Color is an important part of visual design, and can be benficial to legibility and understanding, when used properly. Success Criteria 1.4.1 and 1.4.3 require that color be used appropriately and be of sufficient contrast.</p>

                    <p>When using color in content design, consider the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Color cannot be the sole means of identifying something (e.g., identifying correct answers to a problem set in green text). Other visual differentiators should be used in addition to color, like icons, text decoration (underlining, bold, italics), or through the text content itself (e.g. identifying correct answers with an opening prefix like "Answer:").</li>
                        <li>The colors used for text, visual components, and backgrounds should be sufficiently contrasted. The minimum level of contrast for large text elements or components and their borders or backgrounds is 3:1. The minimum level of contrast for text is 4.5:1.</li>
                        <li>When determining which colors to use it is important to test options using color inversion settings, high-contrast modes, and filters that demonstrate different types of color perception conditions (protanopia, deuteranopia, etc.). The color combinations you use may meet contrast requirements but be less than ideal when viewed through these methods.</li>

                <h4>Non-text content or images of text</h4>

                <p>Non-text content like images, videos, visualizations, or graphs can be an essential part of understanding the book content. For some readers, non-text content can increase their ability to comprehend or synthesize the text content or subject matter. When designing the book, it's important to consider the formatting and placement of this content to maximize the benefit to the reader.</p>

                <p>To meet Success Criteria 1.1.1 and 1.4.5, it's required to provide textual alternatives for the content. For 1.4.5 in particular, it's important to consider whether the textual content in the image needs to be an image, or might be incorporated into the surrounding content.</p>

                <p>For users that are engaging with the content visually, it's important to consider:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Usage of color and color contrast</li>
                    <li>Adaptability, can the user zoom into the image or visualization without loss of quality or legibility</li>

                <h4>Font selection</h4>

                <p>There is no single font that meets the legibility needs of all users, but considering certain font characteristics to increase legibility is possible. When planning font selections in fixed layout publications, consider the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Font sizing</li>
                    <li>Font weight</li>
                    <li>Font face or style</li>
                </ul>

                <section id="legibility-fonts-sizing">
                    <h5>Font sizing</h5>

                    <p>There is no font size guideline in WCAG [[wcag2]] stating a specific font size, and the standard default font size in most desktop and mobile browsers is 16px for body text (i.e. in a <code>p</code> element). This size is sufficient for most content, and headings should be based off of it by using <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> sizing in CSS [[css2]]. If content contains a great deal of text, it is also recommended to consider a larger body font size like 18pt to ensure readability.</p>

                    <p>WCAG success criteria 1.4.4 Resize Text does specify that text needs to be able to resize to 200% of its default size without loss of readability or functionality. In fixed layout content, this would be achieved by the user zooming into the page 200% or more.</p>

                    <p>Content creators should also ensure font size patterns are consistent throughout the content, to assist users in differentiating and contextualizing the content.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="legibility-fonts-weight">
                    <h5>Font weight</h5>

                    <p>Depending on the chosen font, it might be necessary to consider the weight of the font to make it more legible. A font weight of 400 is considered normal or regular, but depending on the font face, may be too light. A font that is too light can disappear into the background of a page, especially if factors like clarity or contrast are not considered. A font weight of 700 is considered bold, and would be more readable, but overusing a bold typeface can present its own issues for legibility.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="legibility-fonts-face">
                    <h5>Font face</h5>

                    <p>Selecting a font face for your content can depend on a number of factors. When choosing a font for fixed layout content it is important for content creators to consider readability because a user will not be able to alter the font face to suit their needs or preferences.</p>

                    <p>One of the most important factors for the readability of fonts relates to character differentiation. Character differentiation in a font is a strong indicator of readability, specifically for characters that have similar shapes in a font face. In the Latin alphabet, letters like <strong>I</strong> and <strong>l</strong>, <strong>b</strong> and <strong>d</strong>, or <strong>a</strong> <strong>o</strong> and <strong>e</strong> can look very similar to one another depending on the style of the font. The same issue is possible in fonts for other alphabets, particularly when glyphs are similar in appearance or use similar elements. </p>

        <section id="tables">
            <h3>Tables</h3>

            <p>The best way to create an accessible table is to present it as tabular data. This is already documented in the DAISY Knowledge Base with directions on creating <a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/tables.html">semantic tagging for tables</a>.</p>

            <p>WCAG [[wcag2]] has several success criteria relating to tables:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A)</li>
                <li>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (A)</li>
                <li>1.4.1 Use of Color (A)</li>
                <li>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)</li>
                <li>1.4.5 Images of Text (AA)</li>
                <li>4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If the table needs to remain an image, another option is to use alternative text and caption or ARIA roles to describe the data in logical reading order. The caption could be used as a summary of the table, and the alternative text would dive deeper. You would start with describing what the header row is followed by what is presented in each row. You could then dive deeper and list all the data as it appears in reading order.</p>

            <p>Depending on the complexity of the image this may require complex description with one of the following formats:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Providing a long description in text near the non-text content, with a reference to the location of the long description in the short description</li>
                <li>Providing a long description in another location with a link to it that is immediately adjacent to the non-text content</li>
                <li>Providing long description for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information</li>
                <li>Extended description in details</li>
                <li>Using hidden description</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="note">
                Using hidden descriptions should be considered very carefully, as hiding the description as demonstrated in example 4 will hide it from everything except assistive technologies. People with learning or cognitive disabilities would not benefit from this technique. 
            </aside>

            <section id="tables-aria">
                <h4>ARIA roles for tables</h4>

                <p>Provide an extended description for a table using either <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA15">aria-describedby</a> or <code>aria-details</code>.</p>

                <p>The advantage of <code>aria-details</code> over <code>aria-describedby</code> is that it allows users access to the markup of the linked description (which could be the table markup if you put it, for example, inside a details element to collapse it). The current drawback, however, is that there isn't great support yet for the attribute. And expanding details element within a fixed layout page is also likely to wreak a bit of havoc when users click on it (unless you find a way to reliably position it offscreen, but then that limits who can access it).</p>

                <p>The aria-describedby attribute's big drawback is that it turns the description into one long text string that users have to listen to. There's no way to navigate the columns and rows or have headers read out, so it's likely going to be very difficult for users to make sense of except for very simple and very small tables.</p>

        <h2>Package metadata</h2>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-fxl-package">package metadata</a> used in the EPUB is the primary method for a reading system to determine whether content is fixed layout or reflowable. In addition to identifying the pagination mode with <code>rendition:layout</code>, package metadata can also allow the EPUB creator to have some control over other display characteristics.</p>

        <p>These display characteristics include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>rendition:orientation</code> - the orientation of the book, can be <code>landscape</code>, <code>portrait</code>, or <code>auto</code></li>
            <li><code>rendition:spread</code> - the spread settings of the book, can be <code>none</code>, <code>landscape</code>, <code>both</code>, or <code>auto</code></li>
            <li><code>rendition:page-spread-*</code> - spread settings for individual spine items, can be <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>center</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The default value for the <code>orientation</code> and <code>spread</code> properties is <code>auto</code>, which means that the reading system settings or defaults take effect.</p>

        <p>It is advised that EPUB creators must not set a specific <code>orientation</code> property, as this can interfere with user device preferences in accordance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#orientation">WCAG Success Criteria 1.3.4</a>. It is especially important for users who may be unable to change the orientation of their device to match the content settings.</p>

            <h3>Access mode sufficient</h3>

            <p>The schema.org property <code>accessModeSufficient</code> is used to define the combinations in which this book can be consumed be that <code>visual</code>, <code>textual</code>, <code>auditory</code>, or <code>tactile</code>.</p>

            <p>For picture books with no text, or no alternative text, the way one would consume this would be completely visually so having <code>accessModeSufficient</code> of <code>visual</code> would be solely defined.</p>

            <aside class="example" title="Single access mode sufficient visual example">
                <pre>
&lt;meta property="schema:accessModeSufficient"&gt;
visual

                </pre>
            </aside>

            <p>For fixed layout books that have both visual and textual elements having <code>accessModeSufficient</code> of <code>visual,textual</code> would be appropriate. In addition, if the fixed layout book is primarily images that are fully described, <code>textual</code> would also apply, as this implies the boook is Screen Reader Friendly and can be fully read by assistive technology.</p>

            <aside class="example" title="Multiple access mode sufficient example">
                <pre>

visual,textual
&lt;/meta&gt;
                </pre>
            </aside>

            <p>If a fixed layout book has all images fully described then having <code>accessModeSufficient</code> of <code>textual</code> would be appropriate which implies this book is Screen Reader Friendly and can be fully read by assistive technology.</p>

            <aside class="example" title="Access mode sufficient textual example">
                <pre>

            <p>The schema.org property <code>accessibilitySummary</code> is a human readable statement on how accessible or inaccessible the book is.</p>

a textual description to aid in accessibility.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>An EPUB reading system can take many forms. It might have a visual display area for rendering the content to users, for example, or it might only provide audio playback of the content. Therefore, there is no single set of rules that applies to all reading systems.</p>
